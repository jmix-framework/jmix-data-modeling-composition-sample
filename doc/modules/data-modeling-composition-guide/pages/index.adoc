[[association-vs-composition]]
== Association vs. Composition

In Jmix, relationships between entities can be defined as either `Associations` or `Compositions`, depending on the desired level of coupling and lifecycle control.

An `Association` establishes a flexible link between entities that can exist independently. For example, a `Customer` and a `Product` can be associated, but neither depends on the other for its existence.

A `Composition`, on the other hand, enforces a "master-detail" relationship. Detail entities are tightly coupled to their master, meaning they cannot exist independently. This type of relationship is useful when you want to ensure transactional consistency and lifecycle management across related entities.

In the context of the Jmix Petclinic example, the relationship between an `Owner` and their `Addresses` is an example of a composition. An `Address` that does not belong to an `Owner` has no meaning within this domain. Changes made to an `Owner` and their `Addresses` are managed together and saved as part of a single transaction, ensuring data consistency.

Compositions are closely related to the concept of aggregates, as described in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Aggregates group related entities into a single, consistent structure with a root entity managing its components. For more details on how Jmix handles editing aggregates, see:
xref:concepts:features.adoc#editing-aggregates[Concepts: Editing Aggregates].

[NOTE]
====
Compared to the JPA association annotations like `@OneToMany`, `@Composition` is a Jmix-specific concept and has no direct equivalent in JPA. While JPA focuses primarily on persistence and relationships at the database level, `Composition` in Jmix extends beyond persistence to also define behaviors in the user interface and the data lifecycle. For this reason, the `@Composition` annotation is part of the Jmix framework and not part of JPA.

[[why-use-composition]]
== Why and When to Use Composition

Compositions in Jmix offer a structured approach to modeling tightly coupled relationships between entities. One of their main advantages is transactional consistency, as changes to the master entity and its associated detail entities are committed within a single transaction. This ensures that the data remains consistent, even in more complex editing scenarios.

Compositions also simplify lifecycle management. By tightly coupling entities, Jmix handles operations such as cascading deletes or updates automatically, reducing the need for developers to manage these relationships manually. This streamlining of lifecycle operations helps to minimize boilerplate code and potential errors.

An additional benefit of compositions is their impact on user interface design. They enable intuitive editing workflows by allowing related entities to be managed in the same view or context, which simplifies the user experience. However, this approach may require users to adjust, as it contrasts with the standard behavior of many web applications, where changes are typically persisted immediately. In compositions, changes to detail entities are only saved once the master entity is saved, which can feel unfamiliar at first but aligns with the goal of maintaining transactional consistency.

This challenge is particularly noticeable in scenarios involving nested compositions or when using dialog-based editing for detail entities. To make these workflows more user-friendly, it is important to provide clear visual cues or guidance. Inline editing within a data grid, for example, can mitigate confusion by making the relationships and changes more transparent. We will revisit UI design strategies for compositions, including dialog-based and inline editing approaches, in a later section.


[[one-to-many-composition]]
== One-to-Many Composition

The first example will be a one-to-many composition using the `Owner` and `Address` entities from the Petclinic domain model. The example demonstrates how to configure the data model and UI to enable inline editing of the composition entities in a detail view.

=== Data Model

The `Owner` entity contains a one-to-many collection of `Address` entities, managed as a composition. This is achieved using the `@Composition` and `@OneToMany` annotations. Here are the relevant parts of the model:

[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/owner/Owner.java[tags=start-class;addresses;end-class]
----
<1> The `addresses` attribute is annotated with `@Composition`, which ensures that the `Address` instances are tightly bound to their parent `Owner`. This means the lifecycle of `Address` entities is managed together with the `Owner`. If the `Owner` is deleted, all associated `Address` entities are deleted as well.

<2> In addition to the `@Composition` annotation, this is a standard JPA `@OneToMany` association. The `@OneToMany` specifies the database-level relationship between the `Owner` and its `Address` entities, ensuring that multiple `Address` instances can be linked to a single `Owner`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/owner/Address.java[tags=start-class;attributes;end-class]
----
<1> The `Address` entity includes a `@ManyToOne` annotation, which links each `Address` instance to its owning `Owner`. This relationship is typical for associations in JPA. While the `@ManyToOne` side of the relationship behaves like a standard JPA association, the addition of `@Composition` on the `Owner` entity ensures that the `Address` instances are managed as part of the `Owner` lifecycle. This distinction introduces additional semantics for lifecycle management and transactional consistency in Jmix.

=== UI Representation

In the `Owner` detail view, you can manage multiple `Address` entities directly using an inline editable Data Grid. This provides a clear and intuitive overview of all addresses associated with the selected `Owner`. Users can view, add, edit, or delete addresses within the same screen, ensuring a streamlined workflow.

image::owner-addresses-composition-datagrid.png[Owner Detail View with Address Table, width=800, alt="Owner Detail View"]

In Jmix, there are two main approaches to editing related entities within a composition: dialog-based editing and inline editing. Dialog-based editing opens a separate view for editing the detail entity, allowing for more extensive forms with multiple fields. Inline editing, on the other hand, enables users to directly interact with the entity within a `DataGrid` in the parent entity's detail view.

==== Inline Editing

For this example, we are using inline editing to demonstrate how to manage `Address` entities directly within the `Owner` detail view. This approach works well when the detail entity has a manageable number of fields that can be edited easily in a tabular format. It provides an efficient workflow by keeping the user within the same view while editing.

The inline editable data grid allows users to add new addresses, edit existing ones, and delete rows directly. These changes are temporarily stored in the `DataContext` of the `OwnerDetailView` and only persisted to the database when the user confirms their changes by clicking "OK".

When the user deletes an address, the row is marked for removal in the `DataContext`, but the changes are not persisted to the database immediately.

image::owner-addresses-composition-datagrid-editing.png[Inline Editing Example, width=800, alt="Inline Editing for Addresses"]

To configure inline editing for the `Address` entities in the `Owner` detail view, a `DataGrid` is used. As a first step, let’s take a look at the `owner-detail-view.xml` configuration, where the `DataGrid` is defined and set up for inline editing.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/owner/owner-detail-view.xml[tags=addresses]
----
<1> The `editorBuffered="true"` attribute ensures that changes made in the `DataGrid` editor are not immediately applied to the `DataContext` but remain in the editor buffer until the user explicitly confirms them. For more details, see the Vaadin Grid documentation on https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components/grid/inline-editing#buffered[Inline Editing^].

<2> Columns have to be marked as `editable`. In our case all columns are set to `true` as we want to create completely new addresses directly in the data grid.

<3> An `editorActionsColumn` is added to handle row-specific editing. It includes options to enable editing, save changes, or cancel edits.

Next, we look at the changes needed in the `OwnerDetailView` Java controller. To fully enable inline editing, the controller must handle the creation and editing of records programmatically. For the "Create" action, a new `Address` entity is created, associated with the current `Owner`, and immediately opened for editing in the `DataGrid`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/owner/OwnerDetailView.java[tags=start-class;create;edit;end-class]
----
<1> Creates a new instance of the `Address` entity using the `DataContext`. This ensures the new entity is managed and tracked for persistence.
<2> Associates the newly created `Address` with the currently edited `Owner`, establishing the parent-child relationship.
<3> Adds the new `Address` instance to the `addressesDc` data container, making it available for display and editing in the `DataGrid`.
<4> Selects the newly added `Address` in the `DataGrid` and opens it in the inline editor for immediate modification.

=== Role of the DataContext

The `DataContext` in Jmix serves as a temporary storage for entities while a view is open. It allows changes made to entities—such as creating, modifying, or deleting them—to be tracked within the scope of the view without immediately persisting them to the database.

In the `Owner` detail view, for example, any changes to the associated `Address` entities are held in the `DataContext`. These changes are only committed to the database when the user confirms them by clicking "OK" to save the `Owner` detail view. If the user cancels the view, the `DataContext` discards all pending changes, ensuring that no unintended modifications are persisted.

This approach provides flexibility for editing workflows. Users can experiment with their changes in a safe, isolated context, knowing that nothing is committed until explicitly confirmed. At the same time, the `DataContext` ensures data consistency by grouping all changes into a single transaction when saved.

For more details about the `DataContext`, refer to the official documentation:
xref:flow-ui:data/data-context.adoc[Data Components: DataContext].



[[multi-level-composition]]
== Multi-Level Composition

After exploring a one-to-many composition with `Owner` and `Address`, we will now extend the example to demonstrate a 1:N composition with two levels of nesting. This will include a hierarchy of `Owner`, `Pet`, and `HealthRecord` entities, showing how to model multi-level compositions in Jmix.

The `Owner` entity remains the master entity, while `Pet` serves as an intermediate detail, and `HealthRecord` represents the lowest level in the hierarchy. This setup enables transactional consistency across all three levels and provides a comprehensive example of managing nested compositions in both the data model and the UI.

=== Data Model

The multi-level composition is structured as follows:

1. *Owner → Pet*:
- The `Owner` entity has a one-to-many relationship with `Pet`.
- This relationship is managed using the `@Composition` and `@OneToMany` annotations.

2. *Pet → HealthRecord*:
- The `Pet` entity contains a one-to-many relationship with `HealthRecord`.
- This relationship is also managed with the `@Composition` and `@OneToMany` annotations, ensuring that `HealthRecord` instances are tightly coupled with their parent `Pet`.

Here is the updated data model configuration:

.Owner.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/owner/Owner.java[tags=start-class;pets;end-class]
----

.Pet.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/Pet.java[tags=start-class;health-records;owner;end-class]
----

.HealthRecord.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/health/HealthRecord.java[tags=start-class;pet;end-class]
----

=== UI Representation

To manage this multi-level hierarchy, we will configure nested compositions as follows:

1. A *DataGrid* for managing `Pet` entities in the `OwnerDetailView`.
2. Another *DataGrid* for managing `HealthRecord` entities in the `PetDetailView`.

.owner-detail-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/owner/owner-detail-view.xml[tags=data-context;pets]
----
<1> The `petsDc` is a nested `CollectionPropertyContainer` defined within the `OwnerDetailView`. It ensures that all `Pet` entities are automatically loaded when the parent `Owner` is fetched and also tracks changes made to the `Pet` entities within the same `DataContext` as the parent `Owner`.
<2> The `petsDataGrid` is configured to display and manage the list of `Pet` entities associated with the `Owner`. It is bound to the `petsDc` container, which links the grid's data to the parent `DataContext`.
<3> The `create` and `edit` actions for the `petsDataGrid` are configured with `openMode="DIALOG"`. This ensures that new or edited `Pet` entities are handled within a dialog window, inheriting the `DataContext` from the parent view.

.pet-detail-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$/src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/pet/pet/pet-detail-view.xml[tags=health-records]
----

The `PetDetailView` includes a nested `DataGrid` for managing `HealthRecord` entities. To ensure that changes to `HealthRecord` entities are correctly linked to their parent `Pet` and ultimately to the `Owner`, dialog windows are used for editing both `Pet` and `HealthRecord`. This configuration ensures that the `DataContext` is inherited across two levels of nesting, so all changes—creating an `Owner`, adding a `Pet`, and editing `HealthRecord` entries—are saved together only when the `Owner` is finally saved. The dialog windows stack on top of each other, preserving the context of the parent entities.

==== Dialog-Based Editing and Implicit Parent Data Context

When managing nested entities like `Pet` and `HealthRecord`, the use of `openMode="DIALOG"` for editing actions ensures that the parent-child relationship in the `DataContext` is automatically preserved. This behavior is similar to programmatically setting the `parentDataContext`, but it happens implicitly through the dialog-based navigation.

By opening child views (e.g., `PetDetailView` or `HealthRecordDetailView`) in dialog windows, Jmix automatically links the `DataContext` of the child view to that of the parent view. This ensures:
- **Transactional Consistency**: Changes made in the child views are tracked in the same transaction as the parent entity.
- **Hierarchical Data Management**: Updates to nested entities, such as creating a `HealthRecord` for a `Pet`, are not committed to the database until the user confirms changes by saving the top-level parent entity (e.g., `Owner`).

This mechanism, however, is not possible when using normal view navigation by changing the URL or navigating to a different route. This limitation arises from how Vaadin Flow operates, as navigating to a new route creates an entirely new view instance with its own `DataContext`. As a result, the relationship between the parent and child `DataContext` instances is lost, and changes in the child view cannot be propagated back to the parent view.

Using dialog-based navigation avoids these limitations by keeping the parent view active and maintaining the `DataContext` hierarchy, enabling a consistent and intuitive editing workflow.

For more details on dialog navigation and how it facilitates `DataContext` inheritance, see:
xref:concepts:features.adoc#navigation-and-dialogs[Concepts: Navigation and Dialogs].
